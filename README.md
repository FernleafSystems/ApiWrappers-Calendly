# ApiWrappers Calendly
PHP Api Wrapper for Calendly API (v2)

Implements OAuth (using PHP League OAuth library) and several API Endpoints.

You can use the OAuth Provider independently of the rest of the API wrapper. We've included
some helper classes which we use to abstract much of the OAuth logic used to keep a valid
OAuth Access Token.
